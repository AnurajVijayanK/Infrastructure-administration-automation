# Infrastructure-administration-automation
"Infrastructure administration automation" refers to the use of tools, scripts, and platforms to automate the management, configuration, deployment, monitoring, and such as servers, storage, networks, and services. This approach significantly reduces manual effort, improves consistency, speeds up processes, and enhances scalability and reliability.


Day-to-day infrastructure administration work using Shell Scripts and Ansible is a powerful and efficient approach to automate routine tasks. Below is a breakdown of common administrative tasks and how they are typically handled using these tools.

âœ… Common Day-to-Day Infrastructure Admin Tasks
Task	Shell Script	Ansible
Disk space check	df -h with conditional alerts	ansible.builtin.shell or ansible.builtin.command module with conditions
System updates	yum update -y / dnf update -y	ansible.builtin.yum or dnf module
Service status check	systemctl status / service command	ansible.builtin.service module
User management	useradd, passwd scripts	ansible.builtin.user and ansible.builtin.group
Backup scripts	Cron jobs and tar, rsync, scp	Orchestrate backup flow using copy, synchronize, or shell module
Log rotation & cleanup	find /var/log -type f -mtime +30 -delete	Use Ansible shell or file module with conditions
Patch management	Manual or scheduled via shell	Automate with yum, dnf, apt modules and scheduled playbooks
Security hardening	Enforce via bash	Enforce with playbooks/templates
Host availability checks	ping, uptime, curl	Use Ansible facts, ping, or uri modules
File distribution	scp or rsync in loop	copy, template, or fetch modules
Configuration changes	sed, awk, echo	Use Ansible lineinfile, blockinfile, or templates
